    <h1>Hanni Bot Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Bot ID: 624955196040282123</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how the Hanni Bot ("the Bot") collects, uses, and protects any information when you use its services on Discord. By adding or using the Bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>The Hanni Bot is designed with user privacy in mind. We want to be clear about what information, if any, is collected and stored:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Data Stored:</strong> Currently, the Hanni Bot does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its users, such as Discord IDs, usernames, messages, or server content.</li>
        <li><strong>No User-Specific Data:</strong> The Bot does not store any user-specific configurations, settings, or preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>No Command Logging:</strong> We do not log individual command usage in a way that could be linked back to specific users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the event that future features require data storage, this Privacy Policy will be updated to reflect those changes, and users will be notified appropriately.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>The Hanni Bot does not share any data with third parties. As no user data is collected or stored, there is no information to share.</p>
